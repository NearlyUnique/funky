# Overview

In advance of implementing features experiments and observations on user experience or compiler behaviour can be tested here

## Async

Unwrap Task<T> so that the `OnXXX` handler can just return the real type

## Implicit

Make interface implementation methods implicit so they don't show up in Intellisense (and cause confusion) in the test code.

## Nested

It might be interesting or useful to have local mocks within a test class
